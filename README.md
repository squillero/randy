RANDY
=====

A fiddling wrapper over the standard, beautiful random package. The main purpose or *Randy* is to enable an application to use its own, private, random generator, plus some functions I found useful over the years.  

Intsall locally with 

```shell
$ pip3 install -e src
```

> **Notez bien**: Not to be confused with Francis Horsman's *randy* @ [https://pypi.org/project/randy/](https://pypi.org/project/randy/)
