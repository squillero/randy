RANDY
=====

A fiddling wrapper over the standard, beautiful random package. The main purpose or *Randy* is to enable an application to use its own, private, random generator, plus some functions I found useful over the years.  

> **Notez bien**: Not to be confused with Francis Horsman's *randy* @ [https://pypi.org/project/randy/](https://pypi.org/project/randy/)

I guess these files will never be uploaded to PyPI: install locally with 

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/squillero/randy
$ cd randy
$ pip3 install -e src
```
