`randy`
=======

> **Notez bien**: Not to be confused with Francis Horsman's *randy* @ [https://pypi.org/project/randy/](https://pypi.org/project/randy/)

A fiddling wrapper over serious random generators. Its main purpose is to allow my EA applications to use a private, separate random generator, guaranteeing the reproducibility of the results; plus a handful of functions I found useful over the years.

Strength-based functions are straightforwardly based on [truncated normal distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_normal_distribution), see the SciPy docs on [scipy.stats.truncnorm](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.truncnorm.html).

I guess these files will never be uploaded to PyPI: install locally with something like

```shell
git clone https://github.com/squillero/randy
cd randy
python3 setup.py install
```

or simply move the sub-directory `randy` inside your project.

Have fun. And wear a mask 😷.
